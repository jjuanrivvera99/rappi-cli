# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## What is this

**Rappi CLI** — a command-line interface to order from [Rappi](https://www.rappi.com.co/) directly from the terminal and Claude Code. Uses Rappi's internal web API (`services.grability.rappi.com`) with a Bearer token obtained via browser login or DevTools.

This CLI is designed to be used **from Claude Code** as the primary interface for ordering food, groceries, and more from Rappi without leaving the terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
rappi login           # Opens browser → log in → token auto-captured
rappi addresses       # List saved delivery addresses
rappi addresses set <id>  # Set delivery address
rappi search "crepe de pollo"  # Search for food
```

## All Commands

### Authentication

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rappi login [lat] [lng]` | Opens a Chromium browser at rappi.com.co/login. Log in with phone + WhatsApp OTP. Token is auto-captured and saved. Default location: Bogotá. |
| `rappi setup <token> [lat] [lng]` | Manual token setup — paste a Bearer token from browser DevTools. Use when `login` doesn't work. |
| `rappi whoami` | Shows authenticated user: name, email, phone, Prime status, current location. |

### Delivery Address

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rappi addresses` | Lists all saved delivery addresses with IDs, coordinates, and order counts. The `(ACTIVE)` address is the current delivery location. |
| `rappi addresses set <address_id>` | Sets the delivery address by ID. Updates local config with the address coordinates so searches and restaurants show results near that address. |

### Browse

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rappi search "<query>"` | Searches for products and stores. Returns store names, IDs, product names, prices, and delivery info. Use this to find what to order. |
| `rappi restaurants [limit]` | Lists nearby restaurants sorted by relevance. Default limit: 20. Shows store ID, name, ETA, shipping cost, and availability. |
| `rappi store <store_id>` | Shows store details: address, status (open/closed), cooking time, delivery methods, and full menu with product IDs and prices. |
| `rappi product <store_id> <product_id>` | Shows product customization options (toppings). Each topping category shows: required/optional, min/max picks, topping IDs with prices. |

### Order Flow

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rappi add-to-cart <store_id> <product_id> [name] [qty] [topping_ids]` | Adds a product to the shopping cart. `topping_ids` is a comma-separated list of topping IDs (e.g., `"1720411,1720415"`). |
| `rappi cart` | Shows current cart: stores, products, quantities, prices, shipping charges, and totals. |
| `rappi checkout [store_type]` | Previews the order: recalculates totals, shows checkout summary with all charges. Default store_type: `restaurant`. |
| `rappi place-order [store_type]` | Places the order! Validates cart first — fails if store is closed or products unavailable. |
| `rappi orders` | Shows active orders (with status and ETA) and cancelled orders. Use to track delivery. |

## Complete Order Example (Claude Code workflow)

Here's the full flow for ordering a "crepe de pollo" via Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Search for the product
rappi search "crepe de pollo"
# Output: [900064851] Crepes & Waffle San Martin
#         [3167908] Pollo y Queso — $26,900 [+options]

# 2. Check product options/toppings
rappi product 900064851 3167908
# Output: ¿QUIERE CUBIERTOS? (required) [Pick 1]
#         [3168069] Si, quiero cubiertos
#         [3168070] No quiero cubiertos

# 3. Add to cart with selected toppings
rappi add-to-cart 900064851 3167908 "Pollo y Queso" 1 "3168069"

# 4. Review the cart
rappi cart

# 5. Preview checkout (see full price breakdown)
rappi checkout

# 6. Place the order
rappi place-order

# 7. Track the order
rappi orders
```

## Agent Behavior

When using this CLI as an agent (e.g., from Claude Code), follow these rules:

- **Use emojis in all output.** Make the experience fun and visual. Use emojis for statuses (🛒 cart, 🔍 search, ✅ added, 📦 order, 🏍️ delivery, 💰 prices, 🍔 food, ⏱️ ETA, 📍 address, etc.).
- **Show the RAPPI CLI banner on first interaction.** When the Rappi CLI is invoked for the first time in a conversation, run `rappi` (with no arguments) to render the original CLI output with the ASCII art banner. This shows the user all available commands in Rappi orange.
- **Always confirm before placing an order.** Before running `rappi place-order`, show the user the full checkout summary (store, items, prices, total) and ask for explicit confirmation. Never place an order without the user saying "yes" or equivalent.
- **Always confirm before changing the delivery address.** Before running `rappi addresses set`, tell the user which address will be set and ask for confirmation.
- **Search before adding to cart.** The `add-to-cart` command looks up the product price via search. Always search first to verify the product is available and the price is correct.
- **Check required toppings.** Before adding a product to cart, run `rappi product <store_id> <product_id>` to check for required toppings (marked `required`). Ask the user which options they want if there are choices.
- **Show prices in human-readable format.** Format COP prices with dots as thousand separators (e.g., `$28.500`).

## Cart API Details

The Rappi cart API (`PUT /api/ms/shopping-cart/v2/{storeType}/store`) requires specific payload formatting:

- **Product ID**: Must be compound format `"storeId_productId"` (e.g., `"900006505_3522980"`), not just the product ID.
- **Toppings**: Must be objects `{ id, description, units, price }`, not flat numbers.
- **Price fields**: `price`, `real_price`, and `markup_price` must be included for the product to be priced correctly. Without these, the API accepts the item but sets price to $0.
- **sale_type**: Should be `"U"` for unit-based products (most restaurant items).
- The PUT response returns prices only when the above fields are sent correctly. The GET cart endpoint reflects whatever was stored.
- The `add-to-cart` command automatically looks up the product price via the search API before adding.

## Orders API Details

The orders endpoint (`GET /api/user-order-home/orders`) returns a nested structure:
- `active_orders[].store.name` — store name (not `store_name`)
- `active_orders[].state` — order state (not `status`). Values: `created`, `in_store`, `on_the_way`, `delivered`, etc.
- `active_orders[].eta` — estimated time in minutes
- `active_orders[].store.address` — store address
- `active_orders[].place_at` — timestamp when order was placed
- Products are **not** included in the order response — only store-level info.

## Important Notes

- **Token expiry**: Bearer tokens (`ft.gAAAAA...`) expire. Re-run `rappi login` when you get auth errors.
- **Store hours**: Most restaurants close late at night. Products show `$0` price when the store is closed.
- **Prices**: All prices are in COP (Colombian Pesos).
- **IDs in output**: Store IDs and product IDs are shown in brackets `[id]` — use these in subsequent commands.
- **Toppings**: Some products require toppings (marked `[+options]`). Use `rappi product` to see options, then pass topping IDs to `add-to-cart`.
- **storeType**: Default is `restaurant`. Other types exist for markets/pharmacies but aren't fully tested.
- **Config file**: `.rappi-config.json` stores token, deviceId, lat/lng. Gitignored.
